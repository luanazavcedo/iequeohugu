                            <p> I was wondering if anyone successfully managed to get ShrewSoft VPN Client + SRX working. It seems to be one big mess. This was the most helpful topic, I also provided my own config which worked well for a while, but it seems something has botched it. Maybe an advised firmware update or something, I don't know. I'm desperately looking for someone who has stable. 
Whenever we tried to connect vpn it said connection timeout. All driver version is checked but nothing works. But when we install Pulse Secure VPN Client, it works like a charm. Hope this help someone. But don't know why this weird solution works. Anyone My employer has a Cisco IPSEC VPN server to access my office computer from home. The Cisco VPN client software doesn't support Windows versions higher than 7, so I've been using Shrew Soft VPN client for a few years. After replacing my old Linkys WRT54G router with a Netgear R6400, I can no longer connect to the VPN using the Shrew Soft client. It tells me it's connected, but I'm not able to access the remote network, and after a few seconds, it says the VPN connection dropped. Hey everyone, Client has given me a PCF to VPN to their network. From google I've found the recommended client is ShrewSoft. I'm able to connect and get Status - Connected, but after a few seconds under Security Associations I see "Failed - 1". I am also not able to connect to any machines on their network. Hoping someone might know what the issue is? Thanks. Hi, My college switched from a windows implementation to global protect a few years ago. After reading paloalto's website I was concerned about installing their software on my private devices and used a 3rd party client (ShrewSoft VPN access manager), recently they've updated and this client no longer seems to work. They recommend I use the official 4.1.1 client, just wondering what data they theoretically can capture? Or if anyone knows any alternative (ideally opensource) clients Hey guys, since a week I try to configure the VPN dial-up on a fresh installed pfsense 2.4.4. I tried several configs from devices (2.3.3) where it's running without any problems. Following config: Phase 1 IKEv1 Mutual PSK + Xauth Negotiation mode Agressive My identifier: My IP address Peer identifier: CUSTOMERXYZ PSK:  AES - 256 bits - SHA256 - DH 15 Lifetime 28800 Checked "Enable DPD" Delay 10 Max failu. Hello. I have FortiClient installed on a Windows 7 laptop for connecting to Fortinet VPN's. Recently I've been asked to connect to a customer's Cisco IPsec VPN. The official Cisco IPsec client didn't work on my PC but I found on the net some articles talking about using FortiClient to connect to Cisco IPsec VPN's ( I tried to set up FortiClient but it didn't work. Then I downloaded Shrew Soft's client hello everyone, I'm a junior sysadmin at an IT consulting firms, We have a lot of medium/large clients where we manage their infrastructure through several VPN clients installed on our consultant's laptops. However, we are starting to have issues with incompatibilities between VPN clients and versions. Is there any way to turn all the several VPN clients we use into one? (I've been looking at ShrewSoft Professional license, but I'm not sure if it'll work) Thanks in advance. Hey Guys, I was wondering if it's still possible to use Shrew Soft to VPN into a SRX340? Looking it up, it seems that NCP is the only real way for remote workers to access the network? We only have about 5 remote users, so buying this seems to be a waste. Thanks Hello - I have a BOVPN between two offices. Hardware is different, one side is a SonicWall NSA 3600 and other side is Firebox XTM515. Settings are as follows Phase 1 - Group 2 / 3DES / SHA1 Phase 2 - ESP / 3DES / SHA1 Originally I was using AES-256 on Phase 2, but was getting maximum throughput of 1.0MBps (my upload on the sending side is 40Mbps). Since switching to 3DES I'm getting the full 40Mbps on large files. However, MS Office files load like hell over the connection. A 300KB. 
Hello r/China, so this is yet-another-VPN-related-question. I'm in China for a week, for work-related purpose. I'm working for a Swiss University, that have their own VPN. Very useful if I want to access their intranet and my own personal files, and of course I was hoping to use it to circumvent the GFW. Google Maps, Google Translate are super convenient, and I'd like to Whatsapp my family back home. In Beijing I was staying at a Youth hostel. Had no trouble connecting to a VPN on both their. Here's my current niggle, for whatever reason Microsoft decided the Windows 7/8 method of connecting to a VPN - which was streamlined and easy to use - sucked, and has replaced it with a frustratingly buggy interface that requires more clicks and frequently doesn't let me disconnect. In the office I support numerous customers and frequently jump in and out of VPNs - it's not a serious problem but adds unnecessary delay I could do without. For the record, RASDIAL isn't really suitable. Hello - I have a BOVPN between two offices. Hardware is different, one side is a SonicWall NSA 3600 and other side is Firebox XTM515.

Now when im trying to import the key into Shrew soft VPN it wont ecognize it. The file is named ovpn any free clients that you guys know of that can use these. Cisco ASA 8.2(5) - Changed the outside IP address and now VPN clients cannot connect. Connects with Cisco VPN client, but not with Shrew Soft.and it did before the IP change.

I recently did an in place upgrade on my PC from Windows 7 to Windows 10 and after the upgrade I am not able to install any VPN client because they all fail at the step where they are trying to install the VPN network adapters. Has anyone ever experienced this before. I originally was just trying to get the Cisco VPN client to work so I installed the SonicWALL client in order to update the DNE software but the SonicWALL software wouldn't install. Then I tried Shrew Soft just to see and it failed. Is anyone successfully using the Shrew Soft vpn client to connect to a Windows RRAS vpn host using IKEv2? I can connect fine using the native windows vpn connection, providing the root CA cert is in trusted root of the local machine, however I just get negotiation timeout when using Shrew loaded with the same root CA. Using the trace utility it appears the connection fails during phase 1 negotiation: 17/07/04 17:21:08 -> : resend 1 phase1 packet(s) 0/2 172.20.1.101:500 -> REMOTE_IP.

### Hello! Before I get started, I do know a thing or two about computing and virtualization (programmer by trade), but very little about networking. (Also, if this is not the best place for a post like this, I apologize, let me know where to post instead!) --- TL:DR I just wanna run a VPN and some websites/web servers. What I want to know is if it is possible to host a few WAN-facing servers on my home network, using the equipment at my disposal (see below), while mitigating Have about 75 clients currently set up on Cisco ASA, I use ShrewSoft VPN client to connect to those. It scripts well with RemoteDesktopManager and the config files are easy to sync between my multiple machines. Love that and makes my life easy. I am starting to configure more and more networks with Meraki MX devices, but I am disliking using the PPTP/L2TP built-in client in Windows. I know it works well, but unless I am missing something, I can only copy the pbk file to sync and that doesn't. Hey all, We use ShrewSoft's VPN Access Manager for VPN access. I'm setting up a remote office, and would like to have the VPN autoconnect when either the computer starts, or the user logs in. Has anyone had any luck getting these to work with ShrewSoft's? Ideally, I would like for the drives and GPO settings to map without much hassle. However, if it's not possible, I'm okay with creating a local user account that the user logs into, launches the VPN, and then switches over to their AD account. </p>
