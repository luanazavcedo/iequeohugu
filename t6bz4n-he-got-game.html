                            <p>Directed by Spike Lee. With Denzel Washington, Milla Jovovich, Ray Allen, Rosario Dawson. A basketball player's father must try to convince him to go to a college so he can get a shorter sentence. He Got Game is a 1998 American sports drama film written, produced and directed by Spike Lee and starring Denzel Washington. This is the third of four film collaborations between Washington and Lee. Washington portrays Jake Shuttlesworth, father of the top-ranked basketball prospect in the country, Jesus Shuttlesworth, played by NBA star Ray Allen. He Got Game is a perfect example of the directors sensibilities. Most basketball movies tell coming of age stories against gritty backdrops that all lead up to some big game.

The classic Air Jordan 13 He Got Game that was popularized by MJ in 1997 but got its nickname from Spike Lee’s basketball film He Got Game starring Ray Allen, is making a comeback this year.

Meanwhile, Jesus is shooting around in the gym. Out of nowhere, what is implied to be the same ball from the prison, comes flying into the gym and Jesus picks it up.

I'd never watched a "Spike Lee Joint" until yesterday. But I'm a sucker for a good sports movie and figured I should give it a shot. Honestly: what the fuck?? The music was awful. Literally shrill on the ears. I honestly paused it just so I could make sure I didn't have some B-grade 1930s horror film on in the background.
