I have been trying to install TWRP for quite a few dozens times now via `fastboot boot recovery image.img` and it will recovery boot on TWRP but I cannot access my phone's storage anymore as it only shows the partition with 0 bytes.

Benjamin i bought a reroot tool from the doll planet on etsy. i made it through my first reroot without breaking a single needle. but now on my second one ive gone through 15 needles and they keep slipping in no matter how tight i twist Right now my battery is close to running on empty. I haven't spent one weekend at home in 3 weeks due to work and there has been little to no down time. In some ways it might seem ironic that this has been at the start of my self-love month.

In October I had two teeth (#4 and 5) re-root canalled, and both had crowns put on top. The dentist said that one of them, #5, had barely any tooth left so the crown was very deep. Anyway, since then the gums above both the teeth have been sore. They don't ache, but if I touch them firmly they feel tender. Recently, and this seems to be triggered by flossing the area, I've got a white spot above one of the teeth (the one with the deep crown). No aching or pain, and it's not painful to touch.
